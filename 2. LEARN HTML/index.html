                <p><span>The definition of virtual reality comes</span>, naturally, from the definitions for both ‘virtual’ and ‘reality’. The definition of ‘virtual’ is near and reality is what we experience as human beings. So the term ‘virtual reality’ basically means ‘near-reality’. This could, of course, mean anything but it usually refers to a specific type of reality emulation.</p>

                    <p>Students can use Cardboard—an inexpensive pair of VR goggles made from a cardboard cutout, magnets, an Android phone and an app—to move through an experience that their teacher controls from a tablet. The Expeditions program has distributed the equipment to classrooms and worked with teachers to figure out lesson plans.

                    <p>The use of virtual reality as a training tool is well known, in particular in the field of surgery. Medical schools have adopted this technology as a way of teaching the next generation of surgeons, for example robotic surgery. The medical uses of virtual reality are covered in more detail in our training for surgery article within this section. The healthcare sector is a major user of virtual reality but there are other sectors who have equally adopted this technology for training purposes. These include education, armed forces, construction, telecoms and business.</p>
