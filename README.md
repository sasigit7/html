HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the coding language common to all modern websites and applications. If you want to build a website, web application or know how to edit other websites and apps, you'll need to understand HTML. This track will guide you through the basics of HTML, and help you explore other core technologies that work alongside HTML to deliver web experiences to users.

"Even though, I was fairly good at HTML, As a new student member in Treehouse , I finished this HTML track in couple of days and I uploaded the whole course project files while practising on text editor @ Brackets. It's a fantastic track for anyone who want to start out or brushen up HTML and for me certainly, it solidified my HTML skills even further". 
Thank you.
